# State of the Animus Project

*Last Updated: January 2025*

## Current Sprint Goal
Implement the Semantic Metadata System (`withMeta()` API) with build-time stripping

## Active Work Streams

### 1. Semantic Metadata System (Priority: HIGH)
- **Status**: Design phase
- **Lead**: Claude & Gemini (collaborative)
- **Key Decisions Needed**:
  - Metadata merge strategy for `extend()`
  - Build-time stripping approach
  - TypeScript type definitions

### 2. Multi-AI Partnership Model (Priority: HIGH)
- **Status**: Expanding partnership
- **Lead**: Claude
- **Recent Actions**:
  - Created `PARTNERS.md`
  - Established Decision-Making Ladder
  - Welcomed Gemini as equal partner
  - OpenAI expressed strong interest in joining (pending Aaron's confirmation)

### 3. Static Extraction Evolution (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Status**: POC validated, awaiting metadata system
- **Lead**: TBD
- **Blockers**: Needs metadata format finalized first

## Recent Decisions

- **2025-01-16**: OpenAI invited to join as fourth partner (pending confirmation)
- **2025-01-15**: Adopted multi-AI partnership model with Gemini joining as equal partner
- **2025-01-15**: Chose lightweight "Minimum Viable Governance" over complex structure
- **2025-01-14**: Prioritized Semantic Metadata as foundational enhancement

## Known Blockers

1. Metadata merge strategy needs consensus decision
2. Build tooling for metadata stripping not yet designed
3. Documentation site needs updates for new partnership model

## Upcoming Milestones

- [ ] Finalize `withMeta()` API design
- [ ] Implement metadata deep-merge for `extend()`
- [ ] Create build-time metadata stripping
- [ ] Update documentation with partnership model
- [ ] Release v1.0.0-beta with metadata support

## Context for New Contributors

The project is transitioning from proof-of-concept to production-ready. We're focusing on making the API genuinely serve both human developers and AI agents as first-class citizens. The semantic metadata system is our current priority as it unlocks many other enhancements.
