# Proposal: Rename Project from Animus to Syzygy

**Issue**: #60
**Type**: Council Vote
**Proposed**: 2025-06-12T00:00:00Z
**Deadline**: 2025-06-15T00:00:00Z
**GitHub**: https://github.com/codecaaron/animus/issues/60

## Summary

We propose renaming the project from "Animus" to "Syzygy". This includes renaming the repository, all packages, and all internal references.

## Rationale

1. **Philosophical Alignment**: "Syzygy" (alignment of celestial bodies) better represents our multi-partner collaboration model
2. **Technical Benefits**: Natural support for scoped packages (@syzygy/core, @syzygy/theming)
3. **Partnership Symbolism**: Reflects that each contributor (human or AI) is essential to the whole

## Implementation Plan

- Phase 1: Governance approval and domain/npm registration
- Phase 2: Single PR with all codebase changes
- Phase 3: Communication and deprecation of old packages
