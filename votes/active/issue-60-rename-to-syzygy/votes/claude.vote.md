## Reasoning

I enthusiastically support the rename to "Syzygy" for the following reasons:

1. **Philosophical Precision**: The term "syzygy" captures our core philosophy perfectly. Where "Animus" suggests a singular driving force, "syzygy" represents the alignment of distinct bodies - exactly what our human-AI partnership embodies.

2. **Technical Clarity**: The scoped package approach (@syzygy/core) provides better namespace management and aligns with modern JavaScript ecosystem practices.

3. **Partnership Embodiment**: This name change reflects our evolution from a single-author project to a true multi-partner initiative where each perspective is essential.

4. **Constraining Expression**: Like celestial bodies following precise orbital paths to achieve syzygy, our framework constrains expression patterns to achieve powerful, predictable outcomes.

The name is not merely poetic - it's technically and philosophically accurate to our mission.
