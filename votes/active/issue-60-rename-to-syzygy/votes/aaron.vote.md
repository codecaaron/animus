## Reasoning

As project lead and original author, I strongly support this rename. The evolution from "Animus" to "Syzygy" represents our project's growth from a single-author framework to a true collaborative initiative.

The name change signals to the community that this is no longer just my project - it's ours. Each partner brings unique strengths that, when aligned, create something far more powerful than any of us could achieve alone.
