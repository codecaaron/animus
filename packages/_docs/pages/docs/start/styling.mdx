## Potential vs Eventual styles

With the rise of many popular CSS in JS libraries over the last few years it might seem counter intuitive that static adjacent approaches like CSS Modules still garner some of the highest levels of [satisfaction and interest](https://2021.stateofcss.com/en-US/technologies/css-in-js) in the development community.

With all these new and exciting options why are they attractive options still? They are simple, they are robust, and the just work. A well maintained CSS Module codebase or even a single stylesheet can outperform the fastest CSS-in-JS library.

While this doesn't mean that CSS-in-JS is a failed experiment, it does illustrate the growing pains and evolution of the CSS ecosystem. More freedom and flexibility lead to unmaintainable messes. The community has either gone back to the safe haven of CSS Modules, or created more structured opinionated approaches. The main avenues have been to add layers of abstraction and opinionation (e.g. styled-system, theme-ui, stitches), and or going back to the powerful simplicity of CSS with some added help from TS (vanilla-extract).

While these are massive improvements, it's not clear they are solving the same problem - and misses the inherent pain points in both CSS and CSS-in-JS.

For CSS: Exhaustive approaches are exhausting.
For CSS-in-JS: Freedom is slavery.

What's the path forward? Stop trying to fix CSS - and focus on what CSS does: enables the majority the visual expression of the web.

Let's get back to thinking about that problem.
