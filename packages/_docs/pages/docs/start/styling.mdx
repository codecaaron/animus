# Styling

## Potential vs Eventual styles

CSS Modules and other static styling approaches are super robust and will always be a solid option when picking a styling strategy.  
When implemented with care, craft, and consistency - static styles really cannot be beat on performance and elegance. However, maintenance
of these static systems requires constant maintenance to stay at it's peak performance.

The flow of new features, redesigns, refactors, and replatforms is constant and can leave maintainers weary. Exhaustive expression of styles will always
introduce incoherencies that maintainers need to wrangle and mitigate. The more mature the codebase the more difficult it becomes. Design systems
are the main way organizations fight the tide, providing a consistent strategy and process that dampens these effects. Design system's do a
great job of this, but still provide a static solution to an evolving problem.

It's time to embrace the living nature of the problem and approached it from a different angle. Living problems need an approach that can stay in lockstep
with the changes - one that is flexible where others are brittle.

But to do that we need to change how we think. It's our mandate to manage possible outcomes, static solutions attempt to cover all possibilities exhaustively.
In doing so they often only cover eventualities, things that were ordained to happen within the system. They collect pockets of absurdity along the way as unplanned
or unexpect requirements aren't dealt with uniformly. Eventually leading to a chimera of complexity with no more room grow or adapt. The eventual
is the final state - where there is no more room to adapt.

The way to fix it? Don't even try.

Build for the possible, or suffer eventual.
