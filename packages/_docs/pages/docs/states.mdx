# States

## API

- An object of key/value pairs where each key represents an individual boolean prop (instead of options of a single prop) that can be simultaneously configured. This makes enabling / disabling specific behaviors as needed far easier as they do not need to be reduced to a single mutually exclusive set of states.

```tsx
import { animus } from '@animus-ui/core';

const FlexBox = animus
  .states({
    fit: {
      width: 1,
      height: 1,
    },
    center: {
      alignItems: 'center',
      justifyContent: 'center',
    },
  }).asComponent('div')


<FlexBox fit center />;
```
