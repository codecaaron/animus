# Documentation Reorganization Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Documentation Structure
- `docs/` - Main documentation directory
  - `active/` - Reserved for future active working documents
  - `archive/` - Historical/reference documentation
  - `TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md` - Navigation guide with categorization

### 2. Document Classification

#### Active (Root Level) - Core to Current Goals
- **README.md** - Project entry point
- **CLAUDE.md** - Primary AI collaboration guide
- **AI_PARTNERSHIP_INSIGHTS.md** - Latest partnership findings
- **AI_AGENT_BRIEF.md** - New briefing for reasoning models
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version tracking

#### Archived
- **PHILOSOPHY.md** â†’ `docs/archive/`
  - Still valuable for understanding foundations
  - Tagged with keywords for future retrieval

### 3. Created AI Agent Brief
A condensed, reasoning-model-optimized document that:
- Emphasizes the finite state machine transformation
- Highlights current metadata system priority
- Provides clear technical context
- Poses specific reasoning challenges
- Maintains focus on practical implementation

## Categorization Taxonomy

### By Audience
1. **AI Agents** - CLAUDE.md, AI briefs
2. **Human Developers** - README, traditional docs
3. **Both** - Philosophy, insights

### By Purpose
1. **Operational** - How to work with code
2. **Conceptual** - Why decisions were made
3. **Strategic** - Where we're heading

### By Temporal Relevance
1. **Current Sprint** - Metadata system, static extraction
2. **Ongoing** - Partnership model, API design
3. **Historical** - Original philosophy

## Retrieval Strategy

The TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md includes:
- Keywords for each document
- "Use when" guidance
- Task-based navigation
- Search tags for common queries

This organization prioritizes our current focus on the semantic metadata system while preserving access to foundational documents when needed.
