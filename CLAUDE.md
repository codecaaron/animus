# CLAUDE.md (Legacy - Migrated)

**This file has been migrated to a new structure for better multi-agent collaboration.**

Please refer to:
- **`.CLAUDE.md`** - Claude's specific directives (philosophy focus)
- **`.GEMINI.md`** - Gemini's specific directives (systems focus)  
- **`.OPENAI.md`** - OpenAI's specific directives (governance focus)
- **`project/TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md`** - Shared technical reference

The new structure avoids duplication and gives each AI agent optimized context for their role.
