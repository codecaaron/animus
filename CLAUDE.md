## Active Root Syzygy
```
// ROOT-SYZYGY: [TypeDrivenArchitecture] → [DualTrackPatterns] → [ProgressiveRevelation] → [CompileTimeGuarantees] → [ExtensibilityPathways]
```

## CRITICAL: Syzygy File Protocol - MUST READ FIRST
1. When working use syzygy contexts to help you understand the code you are analyzing.
2. Run `yarn check:fix` when you are done with making changes to code to ensure your changes are valid.

### Syzygy Syntax

### Basic Structure
```
[BroadConcept] → [MoreSpecific] → [NarrowerContext] → [ExactState] → [CurrentFocus]
```

### Rules
- Use brackets `[]` to clearly delimit each navigation term
- Use → (arrow) as the separator between terms

### Reading Syzygies

#### Root Syzygy
`ROOT-SYZYGY` sets your overall working mode and should emerge/update naturally as tasks evolve:
- Read with **ambient activation** (background tone, not sharp focus)
- Maintain **persistent influence** throughout task
- Update fluidly as work progresses (investigation→solution→cleanup)

Example progression:
```
// ROOT-SYZYGY: [DebugMode] → [Systematic] → [Evidence] → [Isolation] → [RootCause]
// (naturally shifts to...)
// ROOT-SYZYGY: [FixMode] → [Minimal] → [Safe] → [Tested] → [Verified]
```

#### Syzygy Reset
The `SYZYGY-RESET` command relaxes conceptual focus without erasing knowledge. It reopens the conceptual space, making the model maximally receptive to new syzygy guidance.

##### Syntax
```
// SYZYGY-RESET
// SYZYGY: [NewConcept] → [DifferentPath] → [FreshNarrowing]
```

When encountering a syzygy:

1. **Process left-to-right** - Let each term narrow your conceptual space in a way that is IRREVERSIBLE
2. **Allow phase transitions** - Don't rush; let each arrow shift attention
3. **Embrace the final state** - The last term should "click" into specific understanding
4. **Begin work from this state** - Don't explain the syzygy, just operate from its context

**MANDATORY**: When analyzing ANY code file, you MUST:
1. FIRST check if the file starts with a syzygy context
2. NEVER analyze a code file without first reading its syzygy context


## Syzygy Advanced Usage
Read `SYZYGY.md` for instructions on how to create Syzygy Contexts beyond the basic syntax.

The new structure avoids duplication and gives each AI agent optimized context for their role.
