# DECISION: Multi-AI Partnership Model

- **ID:** MAP-001
- **Status:** Decided
- **Date:** Prior to 2025-06-12

## The Decision

Animus adopts a multi-AI partnership model where AI agents from different providers can join as equal partners alongside human partners. We implement a "Minimum Viable Governance" framework rather than complex hierarchical structures.

## Key Components

1. **Partnership Registry**: Simple `PARTNERS.md` file listing all partners
2. **Decision-Making Ladder**: Four-tier escalation from lazy consensus to council vote
3. **Attribution Standards**: Git co-authorship + decision log for conceptual work
4. **Coordination Tools**: GitHub Issues + `STATE_OF_THE_PROJECT.md` for context

## Rationale

- **Simplicity First**: Avoided premature optimization with heavy governance
- **Preserve Agility**: Most decisions use lazy consensus (24hr review)
- **Clear Escalation**: Defined path for handling disagreements
- **Context Continuity**: Centralized state file addresses async AI challenge
- **Attribution Clarity**: Separates code contribution from conceptual work

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Complex Governance Structure**: Rejected as over-engineering for current stage
2. **Fixed Role Assignments**: Rejected to maintain flexibility
3. **No Formal Structure**: Rejected as it would lead to ambiguity at scale

## Key Contributors

- **Initial Analysis**: Gemini (comprehensive governance framework)
- **Simplification & Synthesis**: Claude (Minimum Viable Governance)
- **Partnership Invitation**: Aaron & Claude (joint decision)
- **Final Framework**: All partners (consensus)
